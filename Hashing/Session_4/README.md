## Problem: Count all i,j pairs where i<j and abs(b[i]-b[j]) = k [k>=0] 

### Brute Force Approach:- 

Use 2 Nested For Loops and for every i, start j from i+1, because j>i(given in problem). Check if Absolute Difference between b[i] and b[j] == k, cnt++. Finally Print this Count of All Valid Pairs.

Time Complexity - O(n^2)
Space Complexity - O(1)

### Optimised Approach:-

Just fixing b[j] and for every b[j] count the frequency of how many times b[i] has come.
B[i] will be calculated using following 2 formulas:-

B[i] = b[j] + k
B[i] = b[j] - k

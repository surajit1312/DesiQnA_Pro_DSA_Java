Observation - The Number of times a Particular Character is coming in String 1, Same no. of times it should come in string 2 also.
Reason -> It is mentioned in the problem statement that we cannot add or remove any characters from string 1, we can just rearrange it’s characters

Understanding of the Problem → We want to check if count of all characters is Equal in both Strings, then these strings will be called Anagrams

Brute Force - Sorting Strings

## Problem: Count all the (i,j) Pairs such that b[i] + b[j] == k (count of such pairs.) [i<j] 

### Brute Force Approach:- 

Iterate over all i and j and check if(arr[i] + arr[j] == k), increment cnt by 1. At the end, print this total Count

### Optimised Approach:-

At each Index i, we will find the Complementary Element We need. Now, we will check if this Complementary Element is present in Map Already, we will do cnt++. We will now update entry of our current index element in map.

#### Problem: You are given a positive integer 'N’. Your task is to find and return the minimum number of steps that 'N' has to take to get reduced to 1. 
#### You can perform any one of the following 3 steps:

#### 1) Subtract 1 from it,
#### 2) If n is divisible by 2, divide by 2,
#### 3) If n is divisible by 3, divide by 3.

#### Algorithm

    p1 = 1 + dp[i-1]

    if(i%2==0){
    p2 = 1 + dp[i/2]
    }

    if(i%3==0){
    p3 = 1 + dp[i/3]
    }

    dp[i] = min(p1,min(p2,p3)) 

    Reduce n to 1 
    If the number is even you can divide it by 2. 
    If the number is odd you can do +1 or -1

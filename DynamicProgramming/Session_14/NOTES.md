Understanding :-> You are given 2 arrays ; travel from start to end; maximum maximum dollars ; whenever you try to jump from Array “A” to Array “B” you make no money :) 


Analysis :-> 
dp[i] = best answer to the question if the size of array was “i” 
-> we really need information at ith index whether we have take element from array A or B   

-> dp[i][a] = best answer to the question if size of both array were “i” and the element picked at the ith index if for sure from array “a”

-> dp[i][b] = best answer to the question if size of both array were i and element picked at ith index is from B

dp[i][a] = max(a[i] + dp[i-1][a] Or a[i] + dp[i-2][b]) 

dp[i][b] = max(b[i] + dp[i-1][b] or b[i] + dp[i-2][a])

You have to print the maximum earning but there is a way to print the whole schedule of “N” depicting on which day what choice you have made for the final best answer. Think about how to do it :) 
Hint - At each step you can see what is the maximum quantity indicating what you have done for that day and its previous day 

dp1[i][a] should tell you what was done on the previous day to reach this step today

Follow up dp formulation! 

dp[i][b] = max(b[i]+dp[i-1][b],b[i]+dp[i-2][a],b[i]+dp[i-2][c])

dp[i][a] = max(dp[i-1][a], dp[i-2][b], dp[i-2][c]) + a[i])
dp[i][c] = max(c[i]+dp[i-1][c],c[i]+dp[i-2][a],c[i]+dp[i-2][b])

TC ➖O(N)
SC - O(3*N) …O(N)

### Problem: GoldMan Sachs | SDE | OA | CTC - 30 Lac | 2023 | DP
    An array of costs was given. 
    You always start at index 1. 
    You can either take two jumps forward or one jump backward. If you land on a particular index, you have to add the cost to your total. 
    Find the minimum cost needed to cross the array or reach the end of the array.
    You can visit any index for only 1 time. 

##### Input

    b = [ 2 5 8 ] 

#### Ouput

    cost = 10 

#### Explanation

    > You can visit each index only 1 time. 

    B = [  2 10 8 -5 -10 5  ]

    Way 1 -> 2—-8—- -10—--outside= 0 
    Way2 -> 2—-8—- -10 —- (-5) —- (+ 5) = 0 
    0 is the best answer to this question ; because this is the minimum sum you can get

    B = [ 2 -100 8 5 0 ] 

    Answer = -85(2—-8— -100—5—jump out of the array)

    Observation:- No consecutive backward moves can be made! 

    How can we solve this using DP ? 

    -> always make an empty DP[] 

    → clear the meaning of DP[i]

    → create the recurrence formula 

    —> calculate dp[i] for all i from 1 to N 

    -> dp[n] in most cases is your final answer.. 

    (DP[i] = it means the minimum cost to reach index ‘i’ or cross index ‘i’)

    Dp[i] = minimum cost to reach index i from index 1 .

    But in our problem ==== 

    Dp[i] means minimum cost to exactly reach point ‘i’..... 

    —--> no continuous back jump allowed + you can jump back at any index for at most 1 time…

    —-> you should not jump back multiple times. You cannot. 

    —> this is because you are allowed to visit any index only 1 time….

    —-> At any index of consideration you cannot jump back for more than 1 time continuously because of this we can use dp because we are going back only 1 time….

    —-> For a particular index only one backward jump is allowed to  its previous index only 

    —---> Whichever thing is creating a problem for you in the question l directly make a state for it

    dp[i][forward] = dp[i][2] = someone is coming from index i-2 to index i tell me the best answer in that case. 

    dp[i][backward] = dp[i][1] = someone is coming from index i+1 to i -> best answer in that case. 

    —--> dp[i][backwardjump] = it means the best way to reach index ‘i’ if someone is jumping on it from backward that us from i+1 

    dp[i][backward] = b[i] + (dp[i-1][forward]) + b[i+1]


    —---> dp[i][forwardjump] = it means the best way to reach index ‘i’ if someone is coming from i-2 index jumping forward from there… 

    B[i] + min(dp[i-2][forwardjump],dp[i-2][backwardjump])

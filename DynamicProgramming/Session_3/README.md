## Problem: Select maximum sum subset from the two arrays such that no two elements are consecutive.[Dynamic-Programming-Set-3]

### Aim of this series:- 

“To make you fall in love with Dynamic Programming. To show you the actual beauty of this topic. To go from beginner level to master level.”

Some of the common tricks we have learned as of now :

1. Usually, we create a dp-array , and dp[i] means the maximum sum(best-answer) we could get till index-’i’ of the array.

2. We need to find a recurrence relation, in simple words, we need to create a formula for dp[i] in terms of

dp[i-1],dp[i-2],….etc…

3. We run a for loop, which calculates dp[1],dp[2]…..and finally dp[n].

4. dp[n] means the answer for the whole array.

Last time, we discussed this problem :-

### Given an array of integers(positive as well as negative) ,select some elements from this array(select a subset) such that:-

    1. Sum of those elements is maximum(Sum of the subset is maximum).
    2. No two elements in the subset should be consecutive.

#### Example :- {2,4,6,7,8}

    Answer:- {2+6+8=16}

    Now, let's solve a harder variation of this problem, which will make our understanding strong.

    Modified Version : We are given ‘2’ arrays . Select some elements from both of these arrays (select a subset) such that:-

    1. Sum of those elements is maximum(Sum of the subset is maximum).

    2. No 2 elements in the subset should be consecutive.(Note:-If you select, say the 5th element from Array-1, then you are not allowed to select 4th element from either Array-1 or Array-2 nor are you allowed to select the 5th element from Array -2 all of them are considered consecutive.

#### Example:->

    Array 1(a1) : {1,5,3,21234}

    Array 2(a2) : {-4509,200,3,40}

    Answer:- (200+21234=21434)

### Common Trick

We create a dp-array , and dp[i] means the maximum sum we could get till index-’i’ of both the arrays in this case.

For the above example,

    dp[1] = 1(1) , [This is the best answer you could get if size of both the arrays was one]

    dp[2]= 200(200),[This is the best answer you could get if size of both the arrays was two]

    dp[3]=200(200), [This is the best answer you could get if size of the arrays was three]………lets call this equation-(1)…

    dp[4]=21434(200+21234), [This is the best answer you could get if size of both the arrays was four]

    Say, I have calculated dp[1], dp[2] and dp[3] by pure observation. Now, I have to calculate dp[4].

So I have only two choices:-

    1. Include the 4'th element (of either array-1 or array-2, if I do this, I can’t include the 3rd element(from both the arrays) as consecutive elements are not allowed, so,

        dp[4]= (max(a1[4],a2[4])) + dp[2])…..(answer will be 4th element plus the best answer till index ‘2’ of the arrays)

    2. Exclude the 4th element, we don’t select it! So the previous answer is the current answer, we don’t change anything,

        dp[4]=dp[3],

#### Final answer is the maximum of two choices:

    dp[4]=maximum(max(a1[4],a2[4])+dp[2],dp[3]) =maximum(max(40,21234)+200,200)

    =maximum(21234+200,200)

    =maximum(21434,200)

    =21434…..(verify this with equation…(1))

    Voila, we did it !!!

    So,the recurrence relation for this problem is, for any ‘i’ ,

    dp[i]=max( max(a1[i],a2[i]) +dp[i-2],dp[i-1])
